# pypolyfab
Programatically generate designs for two-dimensional devices. A design for a device will be the Device class which will consist of instances of the Feature class


## Device
A collection of features that form the device design.


## Feature
An individual polygon which can then be registered into the Device. A feature cannot consiste of disjoint polygons.

## Demonstration
